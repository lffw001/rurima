# About:
With the `docker` and `lxc` subcommand of rurima, you can search & get & unpack images from dockerhub or LXC mirror easily.       
# Not Only Ruri Container Manager:
Rurima was planned to be the ruri container manager, but as rurima has a full integration of ruri now, you can just use it as a more powerful version of ruri, although the container manager function is still WIP.               
For more info about ruri, see [ruri](https://github.com/Moe-hacker/ruri)      
# Note & WIP:
This project does not follow OCI and can only be a `PARTIAL` replacement of docker, this project is still under development.       
# Download:
You can get rurima binary (staticly linked) for arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64 from the release page.     
Or run the follwing command to get rurima to ./rurima and ./rurima-dbg(debug version):     
```
wget -q -O - https://getrurima.crack.moe | bash -s -- -s
```   
# Example usage of docker subcommand:
Get whyour/qinglong docker image.      
```sh
rurima docker pull -i whyour/qinglong -s ./test
```
Get ubuntu docker image.      
```sh
rurima docker pull -i ubuntu -s ./test
```
Search for image `ubuntu`:      
```sh
rurima docker search -i ubuntu
```
Search tag for ubuntu:      
```sh
rurima docker tag -i ubuntu
```
Use docker mirror `dockerpull.org`
```sh
rurima docker pull -m dockerpull.org -i ubuntu -s ./test
```
Try every mirrorlist:      
```sh
rurima docker pull -T -i ubuntu -s ./test
```
Try failback mode:      
```sh
rurima docker pull -T -f -i ubuntu -s ./test
```
# Example usage of lxc subcommand:
Pull alpine edge.      
```sh
rurima lxc pull -o alpine -v edge -s ./test
```
Use mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/lxc-images as mirror:   
```sh
rurima lxc pull -m mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/lxc-images -o alpine -v edge -s ./test
```    
# About suid or caps:
Rurima does not allow to set any suid/sgid (with root) or capability on it, it will check it in main() and error() if detected these unsafe settings.      
So, please always use sudo instead.     
# Reporting bugs:
Please use the debug version(rurima-dbg) in release to get debug logs, and please tell me the command you run to cause the unexpected behavior you think!

# Dependent:   
rurima needs tar, xz, gzip, file, you can find these static binary for aarch64, armv7, x86_64, i386 or riscv64 in：      
[tar-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/tar-static)      
[xz-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/xz-static)     
[gzip-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/gzip-static)     
[file-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/file-static)      
rurima need `curl` for downloading images, you can find a third party build here (Thanks stunnel) [stunnel/static-curl](https://github.com/stunnel/static-curl).      
rurima also need proot if you are unpacking rootfs without root privileges, you can find it by the following way:      
First, you know your cpu arch, then, for example for aarch64:      
```sh
curl -sL https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine/edge/testing/aarch64/ | grep proot-static
```
You got:      
```
<tr><td class="link"><a href="proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk" title="proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk">proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk</a></td><td class="size">118.8 KiB</td><td class="date">25 Oct 2024 19:10:30 +0000</td></tr>
```
So that you download:      
```https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/alpine/edge/testing/aarch64/proot-static-5.4.0-r1.apk
```
and finally, tar -xvf *.apk to unpack it. So you got proot.static, rename it to proot and put it in your $PATH.
